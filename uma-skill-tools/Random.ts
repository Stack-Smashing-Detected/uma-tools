// random number generator based on cellular automata
// uses the chaotic nature of Wolfram rule 30 to generate random numbers[0]
// technically, you're not supposed to use multiple bits of each generation like this (uses four bits from each generation but generates
// two integers in parallel)
// however we don't actually need extremely robust randomness, we need something with a simple implementation and runs fast
// in practice as far as i can tell the randomness is actually extremely good; it is completely incompressible and passes PractRand[1]
// at least up to 16mb (at which point node runs out of memory for reasons i do not understand but are slightly concerning, since i think
// this should use a constant amount of memory)
// PractRand eventually ends up finding one suspicious DC6 test; this is eliminated by using only a single bit from each generation.
// faster than some random PCG implementation i found on github[2] and much simpler

	// NB. when sampling multiple bits it is MUCH BETTER to generate two integers at once like this
	// generating just `x` fails a PractRand FPF test at 4mb while using both is good until Node runs out of memory (“suspicious” DC6
	// result at 16mb)
	// why? i have no idea. it's convenient for the floats, at least. but you'd think it would be worse since the output should be more
	// correlated this way. who knows.
	// incidentally, there's a huge amount of design space here to explore which i have barely scratched the surface of. what bits to
	// sample, whether to sample both halves (hi and lo) of the state or just one, etc.
	// the current implementation has been arrived at experimentally using PractRand but is by no means the optimal design
	// oddly enough trying to make use of both hi and lo tends to make the results significantly worse, but it doesn't seem to matter much
	// which one is used. my initial thought was to use only lo since the right half of rule 30 is well-known to be more chaotic than the
	// left half. however hi does slightly better in practice, with no anomalies until 16mb. i suppose since it's circular the usual
	// left/right separation of rule 30 doesn't really apply?
	// ideally, it would be nice to get down to something that has good enough randomness but generates 8 bits per CA step instead of 4
